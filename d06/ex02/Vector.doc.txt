<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vector class is used to represent directions or movements and can 
be applied to vector operations. It is constructed out of two parameters:
'orig' which is the vectors origin and 'dest' which is the vector destination

A vector is represented by the following characteristics:
- Its x magnitude
- Its y magnitude
- Its z magnitude
- The w coordinate

New vector can be created with 
new Vector( array( 'dest' => #instanceOfVertex, 'orig' => #instanceOfVertex );

All attributes are private and can be set with set() and read by get()

Vector class contains following methods:

- magnitude() which returns the norme of the instanced Vector
- normalize() which return normalized Vector
- add(Vector $rhs) which returns the addition between two vectors
- sub(Vector $rhs) which returns the substraction between two vectors
- opposite() which returns the opposite vector
- scalarProduct($k) which returns the multiplication of the vector with the scalar
- dotProduct(Vector $rhs) which returns the scalar production of both vectors
- cos(Vector $rhs) which returns the cosine between both vectors
- Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs) which returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right handed set)
